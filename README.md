**This branch is for ver 2 of a solution. It is beta, work is still in progress. For the latest stable release use main branch!**

After Hans Summers (G0UPL) has released his <a href="http://qrp-labs.com/qmxp.html">QMX+ transeiver</a> - it quickly became popular both as a TRX and as a DIY development platform inviting projects like this.

I have made a prototype using QMX+ Dev Kit and later thought that the QRP communiuty would benefit from it too, so I designed PCB's to make the reproduction easier.

The ATU is based on N7DDC's 7x7 ATU minituarized by Barb (WB2CBA):
https://antrak.org.tr/blog/usdx-sota-modular-all-mode-sdr-hf-transceiver-for-qrp-operations/
 
<a href="ATU-100_Custom_Firmware">Custom firmware</a> was written for the ATU.
 
Battery and charger mod is based on my <a href="https://github.com/AC8L/PSU-for-uSDX-SOTA">previous work</a>, which in turn, is also based on Barb's <a href="https://antrak.org.tr/blog/usdx-sdr-ssb-sota-transceiver-battery-pack/
">original design.</a>

**I am releasing design materials, PCB fabrication files, and code under open source license and to be free for ham radio community to embrace and enjoy DIY building. Or commercially selling.**

**This is a humble attempt to contribute to QRP Labs noble mission of providing high quality low cost transmitters to hams to ease their entry to the hobby.**

**Anyone who wants to commercialize and sell this solution as modules, semi kit or as a full kit are allowed to do so under these terms:**

**- Commercial seller can not alter design and has to keep it in itâ€™s original published form.</br>**
**- Recognition of originators and designers AC8L, WB2CBA and N7DDC for their work on their site.**

Because of minimum batch of 5 for the PCB order plus shipment, project is very well suited for the group build or club projects. If anyone wants to make money out of it - you have my blessings and prayers for the success!

There are active discussions on group build and group purchase on QRP Labs forum hosted by groups.io, please visit https://groups.io/g/QRPLabs.

I can only do a limited support and further development on best effort basis.

# Build steps at a glance

**WARNING! Before you proceed with spending money and time, please take a note that the battery mod is compatible with QMX+ 12V build only!!! Do not use it with QMX+ built for 9V power supply, you will damage the rig!!!**

1. Decide how you want to build the ABS ATU/Audio board:
  a. Using SMA connectors;
  b. Using coax jumper wires for QMX+ integration. 
2. If you decided on option (a), ignore this step. Otehrwise for option (b) - build <a href="http://qrp-labs.com/qmxp.html">QMX+</a> with following mods:
   - Do not solder the jumper wire on JP501 as instructed on Rev2.00 build document's page 37! The ATU will play the role of that jumper wire.
   - Make sure to solder-in the 2-row 5-pin female connector into JP501.
   - Plug in a temporary jumper wire (breadboard prototyping wire is a good choice) into the female connector at JP501 at pins corresponding to a soldered jumper wire in the instruction document's page 37.
   - Thoroghly calibrate and test the QMX+ build according to the assembly manual. Making a couple of QSO's is a good idea.
   - Remove temporary jumper wire.
   - If QMX+ was already built and operational - carefully remove jumper wire on JP501, use suction tool to cleanup soldering pads and holes to prepare them for 2x5 female connector.     
3. Build ABS ATU/Audio board.
4. Upload <a href="https://github.com/AC8L/QMX_Plus_Autotuner_Internal_Battery_Speaker/blob/version2-beta/ATU-100_Custom_Firmware/ABS_for_QMX_Plus_1938_board_V2.1_fw_00.hex.zip">ATU custom firmware from this repository</a> into the PIC16F1938 using supplied programming ICSP connector on the ATU PCB.
board)
5. Front panel replacement. We have 2 options for the front panel replcement:
   - Printing the replacement front panel on a 3D printer (budget option). STL files can be downloaded from <a href="ABS_Front_Panel_Mod_For_ATU/3D Prints/ABS Front Panel with ATU Control.stl">here.</a> PETG filament is recommended due to the outdoor exposure.
   - Ordering the front panel from JLCPCB (most aesthetically appealing option). When ordered along with other PCB's - the front panel will add negligeable cost. Otherwise if ordered separately the shipping cost to US (about $20) is the most cosiderable portion of the total cost. There are two versions of the PCB front panel:
     - with LED manually soldered from the back. Fabrication files are <a href="ABS_Front_Panel_Mod_For_ATU/PCB version THT v1.1/GERBER-ABS Front Panel Mod_THT_v1.1.zip">here</a>.
     - with SMD LED factory-soldered on the front. Fabrication files are <a href="ABS_Front_Panel_Mod_For_ATU/PCB version SMD with LED v1.2/Fabrication_Files/">here</a>.
6. Rear panel replacement. There are two versions of a rear panel replacement and each version has two options - 3D printed part or a PCB:
   - If ATU is being built with SMA connectors:
     - 3D printed <a href="ABS_Rear_Panel_Mod_For_Battery_V2/ABS Rear Panel Mod - SMA v2.2/3D Prints/ABS Rear Panel with Battery Slide Switch - V.2.2 - SMA.stl">variant</a>.
     - PCB variant:  Fabrication files are <a href="ABS_Rear_Panel_Mod_For_Battery_V2/ABS Rear Panel Mod - SMA v2.2/GERBER-ABS Rear Panel Mod SMA_v2.2.zip">here</a>.
   - If ATU is being built without SMA connectors (using internal coax jumper wires):
     - 3D printed <a href="ABS_Rear_Panel_Mod_For_Battery_V2/ABS Rear Panel Mod - No SMA v2.2/3D Prints/ABS Back Panel with Battery Slide Switch - V.2.2 - NO SMA.stl">variant</a>.
     - PCB variant:  Fabrication files are <a href="ABS_Rear_Panel_Mod_For_Battery_V2/ABS Rear Panel Mod - No SMA v2.2/GERBER-ABS Rear Panel Mod_v2.2_NO_SMA.zip">here</a>.

6. Build <a href="ABS_Battery_Speaker_PCB/ABS_Battery_Board_v1.5.2 - Front.jpg">ABS Battery and Speaker Board.</a> Keep power (battery) switch on the OFF position until the last moment before closing the enclosure top!
7. Insert 18650 batteries and install Battery and Speaker board on top of the ATU board. Make sure battery power switch is still on OFF position!
8. Insert QMX+ assembly with ABS solution installed into its enclosure, screw-in front and back panels of the enclosure.
9. Switch Battery board's switch to the ON position.
10. Carefully insert and screw-in QMX+ enclosure's top.

# Ordering PCB's
I personally have a habit ordering PCB's from <a href="https://jlcpcb.com">JLCPCB</a> (again, I am not associated with them!). For the convenience, all 3 PCB's can be ordered in one order.
1. ATU and Audio amp PCB. Fabrication files are <a href="ABS_ATU_Audio_Amp_PCB/Fabrication Files">here</a>.
2. Battery/Speaker PCB. Fabrication files are <a href="ABS_Battery_Speaker_PCB/GERBER-QMX_Plus_Battery_Board_v1.5.2.zip">here</a>.
3. Order one of the versions of the front panel PCB (see fabrication links above).
3. Order one of the versions of the rear panel PCB (see fabrication links above).

*If you are ordering PCB's from JLCPCB:*
 - for the front and rear panel PCBs from JLCPCB - select black PCB color.
 - for all PCB orders make sure for the option of "Mark on PCB" - select "Order Number (Specify Position)".

# Group build manager (organizer)
Usually in group builds it supoposed to be the responsibility of a group build manager to:
1. Order PCB's.
2. Assemble kit bags.
3. Burn Arduino bootloader and load the sketch from this repo into it.
4. Upload the ATU firmware from this repo into the PIC16F1938 microcontroller.
- Due to shipping restrictions, group build manager must not source and ship batteries, leaving their purchase for each individual participant.

# Build configurations
There are two possible build configurations:
1. All inclusive - ATU, battery, speaker (audio amplifier).
2. ATU and speaker (audio amp) only.  
- For configuration (2) you do not need to order the Battery and Speaker PCB. If you decide later that you want o add a battery board - you can do that. It is a non-destrcutive mod.
- Barb (WB2CBA) has <a href="https://antrak.org.tr/blog/usdx-sota-modular-all-mode-sdr-hf-transceiver-for-qrp-operations/">detailed instructions on the ordering process from JLCPCB at the ATU link</a> for both "plain" PCB's and PCB's with SMD components populated. It will be difficuilt to add anything else to his writings.

# Bill of Materials (BOM)
Discalimer: I am not associated with any supplier and do not receive any monetary or other benefit from referring to their products!
I am using USA suppliers, other regions have better suppliers for BOM sourcing.

## Digikey part list
For the ordering convenience, below is the part list from Digkey for one build. List contains the vast majority of parts that can be sourced from Digikey except for some minor parts, like few pin headers and BMS battery charger.
https://www.digikey.com/en/mylists/list/WN7WP7HZ7G

## Alternative US sourcing option
If you are located in US,  prefer brick & mortar style shopping and in addition are lucky enough to live near one of many <a href="https://www.microcenter.com">Microcenter</a> stores - it carries many if not all parts in the part list either individualy or in a variety of sets. Look at the Maker section of the store, prices are lower or competitve to Amazon. It may be worth paying a visit to the store, if not for the parts, but to replenish the <a href="https://www.bawls.com">BAWLS</a> stock for sure :smile:

## Approximate cost estimate 
 Below is a rough estimate (with most pessimistic unoptimized assumption) for few configurations based on 10/13/24 simulation of JLPCB ordering plus US shipment and, Digikey part list cost. Estimation is based on a minimum batch of 5 PCB order and can be significantly lower with higer batch size. With current inflation rates next year this info will be well outdated.

# Detailed Build Instructions
(Work in progress)

# Known issues
 - ATU-100 design used for the ABS underperforms on 6m band. If using an ATU on a 6m band is absolutely important for you - build the ATU with SMA connectors. This way when using 6m - ATU can be unplugged from QMX+. Then you can either use a resonant antenna or look for a commercial ATU solution.

# Some future work:
- Design ATU based on Dave's (N7DDC) ATU-10 schematic using latching relays.
