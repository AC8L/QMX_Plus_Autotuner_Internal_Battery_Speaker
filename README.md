After Hans Summers (G0UPL) has released his <a href="http://qrp-labs.com/qmxp.html">QMX+ transeiver</a> - it quickly became popular both as a TRX and as a DIY development platform inviting projects like this.

I have made a prototype using QMX+ Dev Kit and later thought that the QRP communiuty would benefit from it too, so I designed PCB's to make the reproduction easier.

The ATU is based on N7DDC's 7x7 ATU minituarized by Barb (WB2CBA):
https://antrak.org.tr/blog/usdx-sota-modular-all-mode-sdr-hf-transceiver-for-qrp-operations/
 
<a href="https://github.com/AC8L/QMX_Plus_Autotuner_Internal_Battery_Speaker/tree/main/ATU-100_Custom_Firmware">Custom firmware</a> was written for the ATU.
 
Battery and charger mod is based on my <a href="https://github.com/AC8L/PSU-for-uSDX-SOTA">previous work</a>, which in turn, is also based on Barb's <a href="https://antrak.org.tr/blog/usdx-sdr-ssb-sota-transceiver-battery-pack/
">original design.</a>

**I am releasing design materials, PCB fabrication files, and code under open source license and to be free for ham radio community to embrace and enjoy DIY building. Or commercially selling.**

**This is a humble attempt to contribute to QRP Labs noble mission of providing high quality low cost transmitters to hams to ease their entry to the hobby.**

**Anyone who wants to commercialize and sell this solution as modules, semi kit or as a full kit are allowed to do so under these terms:**

**- Commercial seller can not alter design and has to keep it in itâ€™s original published form.</br>**
**- Recognition of originators and designers AC8L and WB2CBA for their work on their site.**

Because of minimum batch of 5 for the PCB order plus shipment, project is very well suited for the group build or club projects. If anyone wants to make money out of it - you have my blessings and prayers for the success!

There are active discussions on group build and group purchase on QRP Labs forum hosted by groups.io, please visit https://groups.io/g/QRPLabs.

I can only do a limited support and further development on best effort basis.

# Build steps at a glance

**WARNING! Before you proceed with spending money and time, please take a note that the battery mod is compatible with QMX+ 12V build only!!! Do not use it with QMX+ built for 9V power supply, you will damage the rig!!!**

1. Build <a href="http://qrp-labs.com/qmxp.html">QMX+</a> with following mods:
   - Do not solder the jumper wire on JP501 as instructed on Rev2.00 build document's page 37! The ATU will play the role of that jumper wire.
   - Make sure to solder-in the 2-row 5-pin female connector into JP501.
   - Plug in a temporary jumper wire (breadboard prototyping wire is a good choice) into the female connector at JP501 at pins corresponding to a soldered jumper wire in the instruction document's page 37.
   - Thoroghly calibrate and test the QMX+ build according to the assembly manual. Making a couple of QSO's is a good idea.
   - Remove temporary jumper wire.
   - If QMX+ was already built and operational - carefully remove jumper wire on JP501, use suction tool to cleanup soldering pads and holes to prepare them for 2x5 female connector.     
2. Build ATU with <a href="https://antrak.org.tr/blog/usdx-sota-modular-all-mode-sdr-hf-transceiver-for-qrp-operations/">instructions at the WB2CBA's page</a> with following mods:
   - Do not source and solther two BNC connectors.
   - Do not source and solther male pin connectors to the ATU board. We will use different ones for our integration.
   - Use only ATU section of the page, ignore the rest for the purpose of this project.
3. Upload <a href="https://github.com/AC8L/QMX_Plus_Autotuner_Internal_Battery_Speaker/raw/refs/heads/main/ATU-100_Custom_Firmware/atu_100_fw_3.2_QMX+.hex.zip">ATU custom firmware from this repository</a> into the PIC16F1938 and plug it to the ATU board.
4. Build <a href="QMX+_ATU_Mount_Board/QMX+_ATU_Mount_Board_Front.jpg">QMX+ ATU Mount Board</a> (install the ATU itself and QMX+ connectors to the Mount board)
5. If building the ATU - perform front panel mod. We have 3 options for the front panel modification:
   - Drilling the factory front panel (less desireable option)
   - Printing the replacement front panel on a 3D printer (budget option). STL file can be downloaded from <a href="QMX+_Front_Panel_Mod_For_ATU/3D Prints/QMX+ Front Panel with ATU Control.stl">here.</a> PETG filament is recommended due to the outdoor exposure.
   - Ordering front panel from JLCPCB (WORK IN PROGRESS!!! most aestetically appealing option). When ordered along with other PCB's - the front panel will add negligeable cost. Otherwise if ordered separately the shipping cost to US (about $20) is the most cosiderable portion of the total cost.
6. Build <a href="QMX+_ATU_Companion_Board_THT_v1.1/QMX+_ATU_Companion_Board_Front.jpg">QMX+ ATU Companion Board.</a> Keep power (battery) switch on the OFF position until the last moment before closing the enclosure top!
7. Upload <a href="QMX_plus_ATU_Companion_Board_ATMEGA328P/QMX_plus_ATU_Companion_Board_ATMEGA328P.ino">companion board firmware</a> into ATMEGA328P chip. Use Ardiuno UNO R3 board for that.
8. Install ATMEGA328P chip into the companion board
9. Install ATU mount board with ATU into the QMX+ board.
10. Insert 18650 batteries and install ATU Companion board on top of the ATU mounting board. Make sure battery power switch is still on OFF position!
11. Insert QMX+ assembly with companion boards into its enclosure, screw-in front and back panels of the enclosure.
12. Switch ATU companion board's battery switch to the ON position.
13. Carefully insert and screw-in QMX+ enclosure's top.

# Ordering PCB's
I personally have a habit ordering PCB's from <a href="https://jlcpcb.com">JLCPCB</a> (again, I am not associated with them!). For the convenience, all 3 PCB's can be ordered in one order.
1. ATU <a href="https://antrak.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/uSDX-SOTA-ATU.zip">(link to download fabrication files is here)</a>
2. ATU Mount PCB - <a href="https://github.com/AC8L/QMX_Plus_Autotuner_Internal_Battery_Speaker/raw/refs/heads/main/QMX+_ATU_Mount_Board/QMX_Plus_ATU_Mount_Board_Fabrication_Files.zip">fabrication files for latest revison</a>
3. QMX+ Companion PCB - <a href="https://github.com/AC8L/QMX_Plus_Autotuner_Internal_Battery_Speaker/raw/refs/heads/main/QMX+_ATU_Companion_Board_THT_v1.1/QMX_Plus_ATU_Companion_Board-Fabrication_Files.zip">fabrication files for latest revison</a>

# Group build manager (organizer)
Usually in group builds it supoposed to be the responsibility of a group build manager to:
1. Order PCB's.
2. Assemble kit bags.
3. Burn Arduino bootloader and load the sketch from this repo into it.
4. Upload the ATU firmware from this repo into the PIC16F1938 microcontroller.
- Due to shipping restrictions, group build manager must not source and ship batteries, leaving their purchase for each individual participant.

# Build configurations
There are various build configurations possible:
1. All inclusive - ATU, battery, speaker.
2. ATU only
3. Battery only
4. Speaker only
5. ATU and battery
6. ATU and speaker
7. Battery and speaker
- For all configurations you still will have to order both PCB's from this repositiry. Even if some portions will be left unpopulated - PCB's are mechanically and electrically interdependent on each other.  
- For configurations (3),(4) and (7) - you do not need to order the ATU.
- For any non-complete configuration you can gradually add other components later on.
- Barb (WB2CBA) has <a href="https://antrak.org.tr/blog/usdx-sota-modular-all-mode-sdr-hf-transceiver-for-qrp-operations/">detailed instructions on the ordering process from JLCPCB at the ATU link</a> for both "plain" PCB's and PCB's with SMD components populated. It will be difficuilt to add anything else to his writings.

# Bill of Materials (BOM)
Discalimer: I am not associated with any supplier and do not receive any monetary or other benefit from referring to their products!
I am using USA suppliers, other regions have better suppliers for BOM sourcing.

## Digikey part list
For the ordering convenience, below is the part list from Digkey for one build. List contains the vast majority of parts that can be sourced from Digikey except for some minor parts, like few pin headers and BMS battery charger.
https://www.digikey.com/en/mylists/list/1DR9PWCRAR

## Alternative US sourcing option
If you are located in US,  prefer brick & mortar style shopping and in addition are lucky enough to live near one of many <a href="https://www.microcenter.com">Microcenter</a> stores - it carries many if not all parts in the part list either individualy or in a variety of sets. It may be worth paying a visit to the store, if not for the parts, but to replenish the <a href="https://www.bawls.com">BAWLS</a> stock for sure :smile:

## Approximate cost estimate 
 Below is a rough estimate (with most pessimistic unoptimized assumption) for few configurations based on 10/13/24 simulation of JLPCB ordering plus US shipment and, Digikey part list cost. Estimation is based on a minimum batch of 5 PCB order and can be significantly lower with higer batch size. With current inflation rates next year this info will be well outdated.
### All Inclusive
 - ATU: $115 per 5
 - ATU Mount PCB: $8.40 per 5
 - ATU Companion PCB: $8.40 per 5
 - shipment to US: $42
 - Total per 5 PCB of each and shipment: $174
 - Total per set of 3 PCB's of each type: 174/5 = approx. $35 
 - Total other parts per 1 build: approx 60$ + shipment.
 - Grand Total per 1 build: $105 max.
### Battery only
 - ATU Mount PCB: $8.40 per 5
 - ATU Companion PCB: $8.40 per 5
 - shipment to US: $26
 - Total per 5 PCB of each and shipment: $43
 - Total per set of 3 PCB's of each type: 43/5 = approx. $8.60 
 - Total other parts per 1 build: approx 15-20$.
 - Grand Total per 1 build: 30$ max.

# Detailed Build Instructions
Can be found <a href="https://github.com/AC8L/QMX_Plus_Autotuner_Internal_Battery_Speaker/blob/main/QMX%2B_ATU_Bat_Speaker_Assembly_Instructions_v1.0.pdf">here.</a>

# Some future work:
- Test ATU and battery charger implications into the QMX+ performance in the context of the parasitic interference
- The speaker and amplifier was a last moment addition with a brief breadbord prototyping. Schematics will definitely benefit from fine tuning.
- Implement band switching for external amps through AUX port. Utilize LPF0 to LPF5 signals from QMX+.
